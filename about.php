        <h2>How We Started</h2>
        <p>
          We started out as just a few guys chilling in a basement. We would do a
          bunch of dumb things like hitting each other with frying pans and wear a
          bunch of rediculous things like welding helmuts with collered shirts and ties.
          <br><br>
          After doing this for a few months we got the idea to make a game about our
          shenanigans. We started brainstorming and came up with something called a battle
          royale. We thought that making a game where there are two teams and a bunch of guns
          and random clothes would be a sucessful product. And yes, we did include the
          almighty frying pan #godmode.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>
          Now that the game is made and out for the world to enjoy, all we want is to keep
          improving the experience. We have big things in mind...Spoiler Alert!...
          a soul sucking vaccum cleaner *cough* *cough*. We also plan on putting in
          a weapon that players start off with and when a player shoots it, it just kills the player that shot it.
          We thought why not put in this courtesy. People can just eliminate themselves
          before they get eliminated right as the game starts.
